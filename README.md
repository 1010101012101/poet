# Po.et

This repository holds three different projects right now. 

### Node 
The backend. Will be split into its own repository, poet-node

### Web 

This will be split into another repository, [poet-web](https://github.com/poetapp/web).

### Utils

Deprecated. Nothing's using this code anymore, it's to be deleted. Will be temporarily moved to another directory, kept as backup. 

Partly superseded by [feed-consumer](https://github.com/poetapp/feed-consumer) and [feeds](https://github.com/poetapp/feeds).
